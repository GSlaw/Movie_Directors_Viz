Project 6 -- Film Director Filmography Visualizations

"Do film directors tend to get better at making movies, making money, both, or neither?"

To launch, please open the 'lba 6' folder in your preferred IDE (VSCode for me)
Either start a live server via extension or launch one via python -m http.server

-- No outside libraries or dependencies --
